DeepWebSampling
===============

Implement 4 to 5 algorithms about Deep Web Sampling

4 of algorithms were mentioned in

A. Dasgupta, G. Das, and H. Mannila. A random walk approach to sampling hidden databases. In SIGMOD, 2007.
A. Dasgupta, N. Zhang, and G. Das. Leveraging count information in sampling hidden databases. In ICDE, 2009

WeightedAttributeGraph is present by my friend - Teacher Lian. Unfortunately, he lost his computer and all the program were gone.
This is the reason I need to implement them by myself. and in the future, i will improve this algorithm as well.

btw, if you want to use them, you need download jung package and jdbc by urself
